              other information that may be associated with your Personal
              Information, such as your Location, IP Address, Preferences, or

              to time, we may obtain information about you from third party
              sources as required or permitted by applicable law, such as public

              platforms. ID verification partners use a combination of
              government records and publicly available information about you to
              verify your identity. Such information includes your name,
              address, job role, public employment profile, credit history,
              status on any sanctions lists maintained by public authorities,
              and other relevant data. We obtain such information to comply with
              our legal obligations, such as anti-money laundering laws. The
              legal basis for processing such data is compliance with legal
              obligations. We may also gather generic, or non-personal,
              information from our Sites’ visitors automatically, which does not
              reveal a Site visitor’s identity. This includes the number and
              frequency of visitors to our Sites, the specific CrossTower Sites
              visited, and the Sites clicked on, your language preferences for
              accessing our Sites, your browser information and screen

                    Usually, the IP address or the URL of the affected system
                    and a description of the vulnerability will be sufficient,
                    but complex vulnerabilities may require further explanation.
