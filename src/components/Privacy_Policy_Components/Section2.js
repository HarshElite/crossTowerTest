      </p>
      <p className="text-general-policy-title">
        5. How We Disclose or Share Your Information
      </p>
      <p className="text-general-policy-para">

        otherwise required by law. We reserve the right to report to law

        personal information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, alteration,
        disclosure, and destruction. While we strive to make your information as
        secure as possible, no transmission system or data network is completely
        secure. Therefore, by use of the Sites, you acknowledge that there are
        data security and privacy limitations inherent on the Internet, and that
        the security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information
        exchanged between you and us, cannot be guaranteed.
      </p>
      <p>

        we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to
        certain parts of the Services, you are responsible for keeping this
        password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with
        anyone.
      </p>
      <p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            All the user information can only be accessed by authorized users.
          </li>
          <li>

            combination
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

          For deletion/” right to be forgotten” requests, we will undertake a
          good faith effort to accommodate requests for access to or deletion of
          personal information. However, these requests may be subject to the
